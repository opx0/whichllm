# Hardware detection and simulation

whichllm detects the current machine and can also simulate hardware for
purchase planning.

The source of truth is the `hardware/` package plus GPU constants in
`constants.py`.

## Detected data

The ranker receives a `HardwareInfo` object with:

- GPU list
- CPU name
- physical CPU cores
- AVX2 and AVX-512 support
- total RAM
- free disk space
- OS name

Each GPU is represented as `GPUInfo`:

- name
- vendor
- VRAM bytes
- NVIDIA compute capability, when known
- CUDA or ROCm version, when known
- memory bandwidth estimate
- whether the GPU uses shared memory

## NVIDIA

NVIDIA detection tries `nvidia-ml-py` first. If NVML is unavailable, fails to
initialize, or returns no devices, whichllm falls back to:

```bash
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,memory.total --format=csv,noheader,nounits
```

For known cards, `constants.py` provides:

- memory bandwidth
- compute capability

Compute capability is used to warn when a card is below the minimum expected by
common local inference tools.

## AMD

On Linux, AMD detection tries `rocm-smi` first:

- product name
- VRAM
- ROCm driver version

If `rocm-smi` is unavailable, it falls back to `lspci` and then
`/sys/class/drm`.

AMD shared-memory APUs are treated differently from discrete GPUs. Names such
as Strix Halo, Ryzen AI MAX, Radeon 8050S, and Radeon 8060S are modeled as
shared-memory systems. If the reported VRAM is just a small aperture, whichllm
uses the system memory pool for fit checks instead of treating it as a tiny
discrete GPU.

## Intel

Intel integrated GPUs are detected on Linux through `lspci` or sysfs. They do
not normally report dedicated VRAM, so whichllm treats them as shared-memory
graphics.

The Intel backend factor is lower than NVIDIA, AMD, and Apple because local LLM
GPU inference support is less mature.

## Apple Silicon

On macOS, whichllm uses:

```bash
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType -json
```

Apple Silicon uses unified memory, so the detected chip memory is treated as
available GPU memory. Memory bandwidth is looked up by chip family when known.

Partial offload on Apple Silicon is not penalized like discrete PCIe offload.
Weights still live in unified memory, so the speed penalty is milder.

## CPU and memory

CPU detection reads:

- `/proc/cpuinfo` on Linux
- `sysctl` on macOS
- `wmic` on Windows

Physical core count comes from `psutil`, with a Linux `/proc/cpuinfo` fallback.

RAM comes from `psutil.virtual_memory()`. Disk free space is checked under the
user's home directory by default.

## GPU simulation

Use `--gpu` to simulate a GPU:

```bash
whichllm --gpu "RTX 4090"
whichllm hardware --gpu "Apple M3 Max"
whichllm upgrade "RTX 4090" "RTX 5090" "H100"
```

Simulation uses the `dbgpu` package for a TechPowerUp-backed GPU database.
whichllm adds extra handling for common aliases and Apple Silicon chips because
those are not covered by dbgpu.

Use `--vram` when a GPU name is ambiguous, unknown, or has multiple variants:

```bash
whichllm --gpu "RTX 5060 Ti" --vram 16
whichllm hardware --gpu "Unknown GPU" --vram 24
```

`--vram` requires `--gpu`.

## Fit types

Compatibility checks classify a candidate into one of three fit types:

| Fit | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `full_gpu` | Required memory fits in available GPU memory |
| `partial_offload` | GPU plus usable system RAM can hold the model |
| `cpu_only` | Usable system RAM can hold the model without GPU |

If neither GPU memory nor usable RAM can hold the model, the candidate is not
ranked.

whichllm reserves about 20% of system RAM for the OS and other processes.

## Multiple GPUs

For fit checks, whichllm sums available GPU memory. For speed estimates, it uses
the largest detected GPU as the representative device.

This is a practical approximation. It does not model every tensor-parallel or
pipeline-parallel runtime configuration.

## Disk checks

The compatibility check also compares estimated model weight size with free
disk space. If the model cannot be downloaded, it is marked unrunnable.

## Known limitations

- GPU bandwidth is a lookup or database estimate, not a live benchmark.
- Speed estimates are order-of-magnitude planning numbers.
- Driver, runtime, batch size, prompt length, and thermal limits can change real
  performance.
- Multi-GPU runtime behavior depends on the inference backend and is only
  approximated.
- Apple and shared-memory APU behavior is modeled as unified-memory style, but
  real results still depend on OS pressure and memory bandwidth.
